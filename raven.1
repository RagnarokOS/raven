.Nm raven
.Nd A dynamic window manager
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm raven
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
raven is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, monocle
and floating layouts. Layouts can be applied dynamically, optimising the
environment for the application in use and the task performed.
.Pp
In tiled layouts windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The default
tiled layout places the master area on the left by default, while the rmaster and
bottomstack layouts places the master area on the right and top, respectively.
The stacking area contains all other windows. The number of master area windows 
can be adjusted from zero to an arbitrary number. In monocle layout all windows
are maximised to the screen size, minus the status bar and gaps. The Deck layout
places the master area to the left, and turns the stack area in a Monocle,
where all windows cover one another. The grid layout organinizes the windows in
a grid when more than three windows are opened on the same tag. In floating mode,
windows can be resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating,
regardless of the layout applied.
.Pp
The default Layout is Monocle. Windows can be split by toggling any of the tiling
modes. The default can be changed via a custom config.h file in the layouts section.
.Pp
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.Pp
Each screen contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the
layout, the title of the focused window, and the text read from the root window
name property, if the screen is focused. A floating window is indicated with an
empty square and a maximised floating window is indicated with a filled square
before the windows title.  The selected tags are indicated with a different
color. The tags of the focused window are indicated with a filled square in the
top left corner.  The tags which are applied to one or more windows are
indicated with an empty square in the top left corner.
.Pp
Raven draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.

.Sh ISSUES
Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey windows
only. The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks ICCCM-compliance in recent JDK 1.5 and early
JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a reparenting window manager. Possible workarounds
are using JDK 1.4 (which doesn't contain the XToolkit/XAWT backend) or setting the
environment variable
.Sy AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
(to use the older Motif backend instead) or running
.Sy Sy xprop -root -f _NET_WM_NAME 32a -set _NET_WM_NAME LG3D
or
.Sy wmname LG3D
(to pretend that a non-reparenting window manager is running that the
XToolkit/XAWT backend can recognize) or when using OpenJDK setting the environment variable
.Sy _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 .
